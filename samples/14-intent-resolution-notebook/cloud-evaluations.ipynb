    "# 🏋️‍♀️ Health & Fitness Evaluations with Azure AI Foundry 🏋️‍♂️\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to **evaluate** a Generative AI model (or application) using the **Azure AI Foundry** ecosystem. We'll highlight three key Python SDKs:\n",
    "1. **`azure-ai-projects`** (`AIProjectClient`): manage & orchestrate evaluations in the cloud.\n",
    "2. **`azure-ai-inference`**: perform model inference (optional but helpful if generating data for evaluation).\n",
    "3. **`azure-ai-evaluation`**: run automated metrics for LLM output quality & safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create or use some synthetic \"health & fitness\" Q&A data, then measure how well your model is answering. We'll do both **local** evaluation and **cloud** evaluation (on an Azure AI Foundry project).\n",
    "\n",

    "### Dependencies\n",
    "- `azure-ai-projects` for orchestrating evaluations in your Azure AI Foundry Project.\n",
    "- `azure-ai-evaluation` for built-in or custom metrics (like Relevance, Groundedness, F1Score, etc.).\n",
    "- `azure-ai-inference` (optional) if you'd like to generate completions to produce data to evaluate.\n",
    "- `azure-identity` (for Azure authentication via `DefaultAzureCredential`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synthetic Data\n",
    "We'll create a small JSONL with *health & fitness* Q&A pairs, including `query`, `response`, `context`, and `ground_truth`. This simulates a scenario where we have user questions, the model's answers, plus a reference ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can adapt this approach to any domain: e.g., finance, e-commerce, etc.\n",
