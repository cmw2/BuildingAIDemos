# AI Foundry Model Calling Samples

A collection of 8 clean, minimal samples demonstrating different approaches to calling AI models in Azure AI Foundry.

## üéØ Sample Overview

### Sample 01: Direct API Calling
**Language:** Python  
**Approach:** Raw HTTP requests to AI Foundry REST API  
**Good for:** Understanding the underlying API structure

### Sample 02: OpenAI SDK with Python (Jupyter Notebook)
**Language:** Python (Jupyter)  
**Approach:** OpenAI Python SDK with Azure configuration  
**Good for:** Interactive development and experimentation

### Sample 03: OpenAI SDK with Python (Command Line)
**Language:** Python (CLI)  
**Approach:** OpenAI Python SDK in a command-line application  
**Good for:** Standalone Python applications

### Sample 04: OpenAI SDK for .NET (Command Line)
**Language:** C# (.NET)  
**Approach:** OpenAI .NET SDK with Azure configuration  
**Good for:** .NET applications using familiar OpenAI patterns

### Sample 05: LangChain (Python Notebook)
**Language:** Python (Jupyter)  
**Approach:** LangChain framework with AI Foundry integration  
**Good for:** Complex workflows, chaining, and AI application patterns

### Sample 06: Semantic Kernel (.NET)
**Language:** C# (.NET)  
**Approach:** Microsoft Semantic Kernel framework  
**Good for:** Enterprise .NET applications with AI orchestration  
**Structure:** Organized into `streaming/` and `nonstreaming/` folders

### Sample 07: AI Foundry SDK (.NET)
**Language:** C# (.NET)  
**Approach:** Native Azure.AI.Inference SDK with proper AI Foundry authentication  
**Good for:** Native Azure integration with project endpoints  
**Structure:** Organized into `streaming/` and `nonstreaming/` folders

### Sample 08: Multi-Model Comparison
**Language:** C# (.NET)  
**Approach:** Compare multiple models with the same prompt using AI Foundry SDK  
**Good for:** Model evaluation and comparison

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Configure Environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your AI Foundry details
2. **Choose a Sample**: Navigate to any sample folder
3. **Run the Sample**: Follow the README in each sample folder

## üîß Environment Configuration

All samples use a shared `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# AI Foundry Configuration
AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT=https://your-project.ai.azure.com
AI_FOUNDRY_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o

# Azure OpenAI (for OpenAI SDK samples)
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o
```

## üé® Design Philosophy

- **"Just the Meat"**: Minimal, focused code without unnecessary complexity
- **Educational**: Each sample teaches a specific approach
- **Practical**: Real-world patterns you can use immediately
- **Clean**: Well-commented, readable code structure

## üîç Which Sample Should I Use?

- **Learning AI Foundry API**: Start with Sample 01 (Direct API)
- **Python Development**: Use Sample 02 (Jupyter) or 03 (CLI)
- **Enterprise .NET**: Use Sample 06 (Semantic Kernel) or 07 (AI Foundry SDK)
- **Model Comparison**: Use Sample 08 (Multi-Model)
- **Framework Integration**: Sample 05 (LangChain) for Python, Sample 06 (Semantic Kernel) for .NET

Each sample is self-contained and demonstrates a complete working approach to AI model integration.
